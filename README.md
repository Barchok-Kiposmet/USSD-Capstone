This is an amount filter application on existing products.
This will simplify the long list of products to only a few to the specific amount applied making it easy for the customer to make a choice.
A mock Mongo db database has been created with a few products to demonstrate the filter application.

## Pre-requisites

Before running add a `.env` file in the root directory with the following structure and update it appropriately

```
DATABASE_URL=MONGO_DB_URL
SESSION_SECRET=YOUR_SESSION_SECRET
```
